1. Price should be editable 

 

2. Aggregate the table with categories , so categories can be expanded further to show all data of this category, for example : when the "appetizer" category is expanded, the data with id- 9,8,5,4,2,1 will be visible. 

 

3. The data must be fetched from db. 

 

4. There must be Save and reset buttons,

      - on save : the edited price value must be saved, on refreshing the page the value must be retained. 

      - on reset : on reset the original value must be visible, and the original value should be there after the refresh as well. 

 

5. Table data can be sorted by price.
